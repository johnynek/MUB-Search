MUB-Search
2009 Dr. Oscar Boykin, Nathan Blythe

Search all vectors in a Hilbert space that are comprised of roots of unity for
mutually unbiased bases.

MUB-Table-* builds a table of "orthogonal to unity vector" and "unbiased to unity
vector" information.  MUB-Table-approx builds this table using floating point
calculations; MUB-Table-exact builds it using exact values (via an extension of
the rational numbers).

MUB-Search searches a pre-built table for mutually unbiased bases.
