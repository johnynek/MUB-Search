An "integral-root Hilbert space graph" is a graph whose vertices represent vectors
constructed from nth roots of unity in a dimension d Hilbert space.  Vertices are
numbered with non-negative integers called "magic numbers".  Each vertex is associated
with a unique vector; given n and d, vertices can be converted to vectors and vice versa.

Adjacency of two vertices is determined by a binary function on the magic number of
the point-wise difference (mod n) between the vectors they represent.  An adjacency
function is described by a set of magic numbers for which the function is true.

If the adjacency relation is orthogonality, a clique on such a graph is a basis in the
original Hilbert space.
