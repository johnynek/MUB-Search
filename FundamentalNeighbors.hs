{-
  Given d and n, find all vectors of the form [1, x_0, x_1, ... x_{d - 2}],
  where x_i is a 2^nth root of unity, that are orthogonal or unbiased to the
  vector [1, 1, ... 1].

  2009 Nathan Blythe, Dr. Oscar Boykin (see LICENSE for details)

  Output omits the leading 1 in each vector.

  Usage:
    FundamentalNeighbors <d> <p> <e> <m> <s> <j>

    d: dimension of vectors to find.
    p: elements of vectors are 2^pth roots of unity.
    e: rational approximation threshold.  Use 0%1 for exact search.
    m: 0 -> find vectors orthogonal to [1, 1, ... 1].
       1 -> find vectors unbiased to [1, 1, ... 1].
    s: search is split into jobs of size s (use s = -1 to see the bounds on s).
    j: job index (use j = -1 to see the bounds on j).

{-
  Sum of the elements in a list.

  This function differs from Haskell's sum function in that it does not assume
  that the type of the list elements includes a working fromInteger definition.

  While the Num class requires a definition of fromInteger, the Cyclotomic type
  only provides a stub and so we avoid using fromInteger here.

{-
  Unique elements in a list.

  For a while I used this function instead of "nub" in lunions, below.  I
  believe this was before I added support for distributing this program (see
  the usage instructions) and so this can probably be removed now.  There
  doesn't seem to be any major speed differences between unique and nub,
  and since nub is in the Prelude we should stick with that.

{-
  Predicate that determines if a vector of 2^pth roots of unity is orthogonal
  to the vector [1, 1, ... 1].

  First, we construct the inner product between the provided vector (including
  the omitted element 1) and the vector [1, 1, ... 1].  This means summing up
  the provided vector, along with 1.  s defines this value (a Cyclotome).

  Second, we construct an iteration of tightening bounds on the magnitude-
  squared of s.  The "tightness" of the bound increases by 4 with each
  iteration.  a defines these bounds (an infinite list of tuples).

  Third, we filter this list to only include those bounds that are tight enough
  to definitively decide ||x||^2 < e; that is, those whose lower bound is
  greater than e and those whose upper bound is less than or equal to e.  t
  defines these bounds (an infinite list of tuples).

  We decide ||x||^2 <= e using the first of these vetted bounds.
